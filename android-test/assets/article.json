            "aTxt":"Budget airline Ryanair is planning to revolutionise air travel by introducing flights where passengers stand up rather than sit down - from £4 per ticket.\nThe airline's flamboyant chief executive Michael O'Leary said safety testing for 'vertical seating' will take place next year when the airline will also introduce a £1 charge to use the lavatory.\nThe budget airline wants to charge travellers for using the toilet in order to 'change passenger behaviour' and fund the cheap 'standing-room only' tickets.\nBut European aviation safety regulators said that the announcement smacked of 'a publicity stunt' - pointing out that such  stand-up perches  would not meet current safety rules and stressing that  they had no plans to change the rules to make them legal. Nor have they even had an approach from Ryanair, said the regulators.\nThe plan is to remove the back ten rows of seats from the carrier's 250 planes and replace them with 15 rows of vertical seats. Two toilets at the back could also be removed to free up even more space.\nBetween 40 and 50 extra passengers will be able to travel on each flight, enabling Ryanair to cut its own costs.\nRyanair will initially introduce vertical seats on commuter flights of up to an hour in length. If this trial proves successful, the company plans to implement the seating on all its aircraft.\nThe revenue generated from charging passengers to use the toilet would pay for the new compact seating, Mr O'Leary told television programme How To Beat The Budget Airlines, which airs on ITV1 tonight.\nHe added: 'The other change we’ve been looking at is taking out the last ten rows of seats so we will have 15 rows of standing area in the equivalent of ten rows of seats.'\nIn the vertical seats, passengers will still be restrained with a seat belt which will go over the shoulder, and will adhere to all current safety regulations which apply to normal aircraft seating, Ryanair said.\nScroll down for video\nStephen McNamara, a spokesman for the Irish carrier, said: 'We are very confident that the seats can pass safety tests. Boeing can put a man on the moon so I am sure they are able to make these a success.'\nMr McNamara added: 'The appeal of doing this is that it makes the costs lower for the airline, savings are stretched across passengers, costs are allocated to more people, all fares will go down, vertical seats are cheaper, and weigh less.\n'The seats are lighter and the carbon footprint will be smaller, as more seats fit into a smaller area.\n'We have polled about 120,000 people - two-thirds said they would consider the seats if they were free, while 42 per cent said they would use the seats if the fare was half that of a traditional seat.'\nBut a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority warned the plans may not meet safety requirements.\nHe said: 'It's aviation law that people have to have a seat-belt on from take-off and landing so they would have to be in a seat.\n'I don't know how Mr O'Leary would get around that one.\n'During turbulence passengers also have to have a seat-belt on.'\nThe news comes just two days after Ryanair announced it is to slash its 2010/11 winter capacity by 16 per cent.\nThe cutbacks include a 17 per cent reduction in its services at Stansted Airport in Essex, where the no-frills airline will be handling 1.5million fewer passengers than last winter.\nRyanair will be cutting winter flights at most of its other UK bases, except Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford, and will - overall - fly two million fewer passengers than last winter.\nMr O'Leary cited the 'damaging' Air Passenger Duty (APD) airport departure tax as a reason for the capacity reduction.\nThe Government is exploring the possibility of replacing APD with a per-plane tax.\nRyanair said it would switch its unneeded London-based aircraft 'to other European bases where governments have scrapped tourist taxes and reduced passenger charges, in some case to zero, in order to grow tourism and traffic.'\nMr O'Leary said: 'Sadly, UK traffic and tourism continues to collapse while Ryanair continues to grow rapidly in those countries which welcome tourists instead of taxing them.\n'Ryanair's capacity cutbacks show just how much the UK's tourist tax and (airport operator) BAA's high airport charges are damaging UK tourism and the British economy generally.'",
