            "aTxt":"Budget airline Ryanair is planning to revolutionise air travel by introducing flights where passengers stand up rather than sit down - from Â£4 per ticket.\nThe airline's flamboyant chief executive Michael O'Leary said safety testing for 'vertical seating' will take place next year when the airline will also introduce a Â£1 charge to use the lavatory.\nThe budget airline wants to charge travellers for using the toilet in order to 'change passenger behaviour' and fund the cheap 'standing-room only' tickets.\nBut European aviation safety regulators said that the announcement smacked of 'a publicity stunt' - pointing out that such  stand-up perches  would not meet current safety rules and stressing that  they had no plans to change the rules to make them legal. Nor have they even had an approach from Ryanair, said the regulators.\nThe plan is to remove the back ten rows of seats from the carrier's 250 planes and replace them with 15 rows of vertical seats. Two toilets at the back could also be removed to free up even more space.\nBetween 40 and 50 extra passengers will be able to travel on each flight, enabling Ryanair to cut its own costs.\nRyanair will initially introduce vertical seats on commuter flights of up to an hour in length. If this trial proves successful, the company plans to implement the seating on all its aircraft.\nThe revenue generated from charging passengers to use the toilet would pay for the new compact seating, Mr O'Leary told television programme How To Beat The Budget Airlines, which airs on ITV1 tonight.\nHe added: 'The other change weâ€™ve been looking at is taking out the last ten rows of seats so we will have 15 rows of standing area in the equivalent of ten rows of seats.'\nIn the vertical seats, passengers will still be restrained with a seat belt which will go over the shoulder, and will adhere to all current safety regulations which apply to normal aircraft seating, Ryanair said.\nScroll down for video\nStephen McNamara, a spokesman for the Irish carrier, said: 'We are very confident that the seats can pass safety tests. Boeing can put a man on the moon so I am sure they are able to make these a success.'\nMr McNamara added: 'The appeal of doing this is that it makes the costs lower for the airline, savings are stretched across passengers, costs are allocated to more people, all fares will go down, vertical seats are cheaper, and weigh less.\n'The seats are lighter and the carbon footprint will be smaller, as more seats fit into a smaller area.\n'We have polled about 120,000 people - two-thirds said they would consider the seats if they were free, while 42 per cent said they would use the seats if the fare was half that of a traditional seat.'\nBut a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority warned the plans may not meet safety requirements.\nHe said: 'It's aviation law that people have to have a seat-belt on from take-off and landing so they would have to be in a seat.\n'I don't know how Mr O'Leary would get around that one.\n'During turbulence passengers also have to have a seat-belt on.'\nThe news comes just two days after Ryanair announced it is to slash its 2010/11 winter capacity by 16 per cent.\nThe cutbacks include a 17 per cent reduction in its services at Stansted Airport in Essex, where the no-frills airline will be handling 1.5million fewer passengers than last winter.\nRyanair will be cutting winter flights at most of its other UK bases, except Edinburgh and Leeds Bradford, and will - overall - fly two million fewer passengers than last winter.\nMr O'Leary cited the 'damaging' Air Passenger Duty (APD) airport departure tax as a reason for the capacity reduction.\nThe Government is exploring the possibility of replacing APD with a per-plane tax.\nRyanair said it would switch its unneeded London-based aircraft 'to other European bases where governments have scrapped tourist taxes and reduced passenger charges, in some case to zero, in order to grow tourism and traffic.'\nMr O'Leary said: 'Sadly, UK traffic and tourism continues to collapse while Ryanair continues to grow rapidly in those countries which welcome tourists instead of taxing them.\n'Ryanair's capacity cutbacks show just how much the UK's tourist tax and (airport operator) BAA's high airport charges are damaging UK tourism and the British economy generally.'",

            "aTxt":"A Premier League footballer broke down in tears today after being acquitted of attacking his pregnant sister during a drunken row in which he allegedly called her a 'form of cancer'.\nCalum Davenport, 28, had been accused of launching the a ferocious attack on Cara after learning she was having a baby with her mixed-race boyfriend.\nLuton Crown Court was told Davenport and his father barged into her home at 2am on August 22 last year to confront her about her relationship with Worrell Whitehurst.\nDavenport, a former West Ham defender, had been accused of shouting abuse before allegedly headbutting her, grabbing her by the throat and bundling her to the ground.\nThe jury was told the mother-of-one, who was seven weeks pregnant, managed to escape from her brother and called her boyfriend.\nWhitehurst then tracked down Davenport to his mother's house and stabbed him repeatedly in the leg, nearly ending his career.\nToday, the former England under-21 international, who has also played for Tottenham Hotspur and Sunderland, was found not guilty by a jury at Luton Crown Court of actual bodily harm.\nDavenport stared straight ahead as the jury foreman returned the not guilty verdict after nearly eight hours of deliberations.\nAs he walked from the dock, there were loud sighs from the public gallery where his family and friends sat.\nThe footballer broke down in tears as he hugged his father, Curtis, mother, Kim Stupple, and wife, Zoey.\nCleared: Calum Davenport (left, arriving at court today) had been accused of attacking his sister Cara\nOutside court, Davenport was flanked by his wife and father as his solicitor, Shamsun Nahar, read a statement on his behalf.\nIn it, the footballer said: 'I am pleased with today's outcome and the jury's decision.\n'This has been a particularly distressing time for my family and I hope now that we can put this behind us and I can focus on my career.\n'I have nothing further to add and I will not be making any further comments.'\nDavenport had told the court he had been defending his father when his sister lashed out and started punching him.\nAs he gave evidence, the central defender, who stands at 6ft 5in, said he was sorry his sister suffered bruising to her face after they clashed heads in a fall.\nBut he insisted it was an accident and he was only trying to restrain his sibling by holding her wrists after she became 'hysterical'.\nSources close to Davenport said the footballer was training full- time and looking to join a new club in the summer transfer window.\nDAVENPORT'S FIGHT TO REBUILD CAREER\nCalum Davenport today faces a fight to rebuild his career as a Premier League footballer.\nHe is now a free agent after his contract with West Ham United was terminated in March and has yet to play a competitive football match since he was stabbed in both legs.\nBefore the attack on August 22 last year, life was looking up for 27-year-old Davenport and his wife Zoey.\nThey had a six-year-old daughter Angel-Skye and a second child on the way, a five-bedroom detached house in Greenfields, an upmarket area of Bedfordshire, and enjoyed holidays abroad.\nBut success on the pitch also led to tensions within Davenport's family.\nFor while Calum Davenport's life held so much promise, that of his sister Cara was proving problematic.\nThe father of her first child Calum Junior was jailed for life for armed robbery and the 28-year-old regularly needed hand-outs from her wealthy brother, including Â£1,000 on one occasion to cover her rent.\nThe footballer, who was reportedly earning Â£15,000 a week at West Ham, also bought clothes for the four-year-old boy and took him on holiday to America.\nDavenport's rise to the top had been a long time in the offing. From an early age the gangly blond, who stands at 6ft 5ins, showed great promise.\nOriginally from Bedford, he was a 'mad keen' footballer as a child, playing for Camestone School before signing schoolboy terms with Coventry City.\nExcellent performances eventually earned him call-ups to the England international side at teenage and under-21 levels.\nAt the age of 21, the central defender earned a dream move to Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, commanding a transfer fee of more than Â£1million.\nAnd despite failing to command a regular place at White Hart Lane, his towering physique and elegant playing style was enough to persuade a number of clubs of his potential.\nAfter an impressive headed goal in a 2-1 victory at Manchester City, he departed for Spurs' London rivals West Ham United in a Â£3million deal in 2007.\nUnfortunately, his stay at Upton Park was disrupted by injuries and spells out on loan.The lowest point would arrive when he broke a bone in his neck during the start of a temporary spell at Watford.\nAfter his recovery, he spent the majority of the 2008/09 season at Sunderland before returning last summer to West Ham.\nIt was then that he was stabbed in both legs by 25-year-old Worrell Whitehurst, the boyfriend of his sister Cara, who was seething with rage after the footballer was accused of attacking the 28-year-old, who was seven weeks pregnant at the time.\nThe stabbing severed 90 per cent of one of the main arteries in his leg and he lost half of his blood.\nHe was taken to hospital for major surgery and it was initially feared he might lose a leg or die as a result of the horrific attack outside his mother's home in Kempston, Bedfordshire.\nHaving spent four weeks in hospital, Davenport was released to try to rebuild his career but in March his contract with West Ham United ended by mutual consent.",

            "aTxt":"A brazen fox crouches on a bedroom window sill after sneaking into a young mother's home in broad daylight.\nThe fox, snapped after it had entered a Middlesex home through the French doors, is fresh evidence of how they are becoming more courageous and comes in the wake of the attack on twins Lola and Isabella Koupparis in East London on June 5.\nGerald McGivern was watching television at the Ruislip home of his daughter Aine Morrow when he  caught sight of the skinny fox staring at him. It darted upstairs and onto the window sill in Mrs Morrow's bedroom before it was eventually chased out through the front door.\nMr McGivern took the photo as proof of the episode, but did not tell his 31-year-old pregnant daughter until a few days later.\nMrs Morrow, who has a six-month-old son Shane, now shuts all windows and is too scared to leave any doors open as the fox still regularly prowls the area.\nShe said: 'It is any parent's worst nightmare. I was heavily pregnant at the time it was taken and it totally horrified me. My dad said the fox wasn't aggressive but he couldn't believe how brave it was. It didn't show any fear at all.\n'Now I have had a baby and the French doors are never open, I dare not risk it. A few of my neighbours have said it's been in their houses trying to get into the kitchens.'\nAn RSPCA spokesman said there were believed to be around 33,000 adult urban foxes in cities across the UK that were generally seen as a 'minor nuisance'.\nHe said :'Some people suggest that relocating or destroying foxes that are present in one part of town is the answer. However, this will simply encourage other foxes to move in from other areas and take their place.'\n\"Therefore, this option is not only disproportionate to the problems the animals are alleged to commit but is also ineffective.\nThe most humane and long-term solution to discourage foxes is to remove or prevent access to what attracts them to the area, he added.",

This is about your freedom, and this is your chance to have your say.'\nVoters are being asked which laws should be removed because they restrict civil liberties, which regulations should be changed to make running a business or organisation as simple as possible, and which criminal offences should be axed.\nMr Clegg argues that thousands of criminal offences were created under the Labour government, but restricting traditional freedoms failed to make the streets safe.\nOther expected measures include a bar on schools taking fingerprints from children without parental permission.\nIn an attempt to protect freedom of speech, ministers will review restrictive libel laws, while limits on peaceful protest will be removed.",

            "aTxt":"Britain could be on the brink of another mortgage drought, the Bank of England has warned, as fears grew of a 'second credit crunch'.\nThe alert will worry millions of homeowners who need to take out a loan, young people hoping to finally climb onto the property ladder and anybody trying to sell their property.\nFears were triggered after the Bank published research today that asked the country's mortgage lenders about their plans for the next three months.\nSounding the alarm, the lenders said they expect the number of loans will plunge.\nBanks and building societies blamed the clampdown on their fears that 'wholesale funding market conditions might tighten in that period', the report said.\nExperts have warned the country could be facing another major funding crisis, with lenders unable to get hold of the money that they need to borrow to lend out in loans.\nMelanie Bien, director of mortgage broker Private Finance, says: 'Fears of a second credit crunch are growing among lenders.\n'Mortgage availability is already tight as funding conditions remain challenging but with some support schemes ending from next year, there are further problems ahead.\n'Any replacement funding will be more expensive, which could make it harder for those looking for a mortgage.'\nIt comes at a time when the mortgage market is already a shadow of its former self, and is still struggling to recover from the recent meltdown.\nLast month, there were just under 50,000 house purchase loans, according to the Bank of England's own figures.\nBy comparison, more than 100,000 were handed out every month in the two years before the credit crunch struck in August 2007.\nThe fall is partly due to less demand, with lenders saying many customers are too worried about interest rates rising, losing their jobs and the general economic outlook.\nDavid Hollingworth, from the mortgage brokers London & Country, said: 'This is a warning shot that we are a long way from being out of the woods.'\nBefore the credit crunch, there were nearly 12,000 different mortgage products for a homebuyer to choose from. Today, there are just 2,600, according to the financial information firm Moneyfacts.\nThe average young person puts down a 25 per cent deposit to get a loan, compared to just 10 per cent in August 2007.\nThe Council of Mortgage Lenders has repeatedly warned of its fears that the mortgage market is on the edge of a precipice.\nIts main worry surrounds the Bank's Â£165billion 'special liquidity scheme', which is being gradually withdrawn and will end completely in January 2012.\nThis scheme allowed lenders to package up their mortgages, and swap them for Treasury bills which they could sell - and use the money to hand out more mortgages.\nAs this scheme disappears, lenders could be facing a major funding gap which they will struggle to fill, a problem compounded by other funding pressures.\nMichael Coogan, the CML's director general , said: 'The anticipated tightening of wholesale funding conditions probably primarily reflects a spillover from eurozone fears.\n'Investors have become more nervous and hence funding may be more difficult to obtain.\n'Looking further ahead, the withdrawal of funding support through the Special Liquidity Scheme is now being taken as a certainty.\n'This, combined with the competition for retail savings and the continuing uncertainty about wholesale funding markets, can logically be expected to have a material impact on lending in 2011 and beyond.'\nIt predicts that there will be just Â£15billion of net mortgage lending this year, compared to nearly Â£110billlion in 2007.\nFor homeowners, the possible impact is a worry. If they need a mortgage, it could be much more expensive to get one - or impossible.\nThis has a knock-on impact for anybody who needs to sell their home if potential buyers back out because they cannot get the financing.\nIn a further blow, the Bank said there could be a rise in the number of people failing to pay their mortgage if the economic outlook deteriorates.",

He will now appear at Lancaster Crown Court for sentencing on July 16.\nPC John Gorst, who led the investigation, said: 'This man has caused thousands of pounds of damage and untold misery to a young family. And by leaving his plea until the last minute he has put his victims through a year of stress and agony.'\nThe couple's ordeal was made even more stressful by the fact that they were planning their wedding at the same time.\nThe builder was arrested after the couple complained to the police, but he told officers he had scoured some of the brickwork because the couple had asked him to.\nPolice have now warned people not to be duped by cowboy builders and recommended always asking for references.\nPC Gorst said:'This case should serve as a warning to others to check references before commissioning any building work.'",

I told him that, at this rate, I was going to end up doing a whip-round with a bucket.\nâ€˜The woman in the queue behind me said she had been there for an hour and 15 minutes. I said to her, 'Well, I hate to think what your bill will be like then.\nâ€˜I had to press the button to ask for assistance but when I spoke to the security guard and told him how much it was charging me, he said: 'Yes, that's correct.'\nâ€˜I had to tell him that I hadn't been there that long and that I didn't have that kind of money on me.\nâ€˜When they sent another security guard round I wasn't sure if he was coming for the money or to kick me out.\nâ€˜He was this big, massive guy - I wondered if he'd been sent to rifle my pockets for the money.â€™\nThe second member of security staff quickly realised the error and took 50p from the shocked shopper before allowing Diane to go on her way.\nHowever, the beauty pageant organiser was flabbergasted by the guard who thought she had been parked up for the best part of a year.\nShe said: â€˜I didn't even think about how stupid he had been until afterwards.\nâ€˜I guess he was just another jobsworth thinking: 'Here we go again - someone trying to get out of paying.\nâ€˜The funny thing is, if you lose your token it's only a Â£15 fine to get out.â€™\nShe added: â€˜Thankfully I had a tent in the car if I'd had to stay there.\nâ€˜The other week I went shopping in Birmingham for an outfit. My husband asked how I could spend eight hours looking for one dress.\nâ€˜I'd hate to imagine what he would have thought if I had been out for that long.\nâ€˜I've told him he can't have anymore pocket money now because I need it for the parking.\nâ€˜I do shop quite a bit, but I haven't been out shopping for 308 days yet. The girls of Sex and the City would have nothing on me.â€™\nThe Clock Tower Shopping Centre advertises on its website that shoppers can use its car park for as little as 50p.\nManager Tony Spencer said: â€˜We do apologise to Diane and we sorted everything out with her straightaway.\nâ€˜As far as I know the machine and all the tokens have been tested since then and the only thing we can put it down to is a faulty token.\nâ€˜This system has been in our car park for about five years and so far it's served us well and because it's token-operated doesn't waste any paper.\nâ€˜It's the first time I've seen anything like this happen.\nâ€˜If she had been there for that length of time she must have done a lot of shopping.â€™",

Words lose their meaning in these agonising moments. Help us save our mother.â€™\nAshtiani, 43, was convicted of having an â€˜illicit relationshipâ€™ with two men in May 2006 and received 99 lashes as her sentence.\nDespite this, she was later convicted of â€˜adultery while being marriedâ€™ and was sentenced to death by stoning.\nShe has retracted a â€˜confessionâ€™ she said was made under duress.\nUnder Iranâ€™s Islamic penal code adultery is punishable by stoning to death or flogging, while hanging is the penalty for murder and other capital crimes such as drug trafficking.\nAccording to the countryâ€™s law the stones must be neither too big nor too small, so that death is neither mercifully quick nor endlessly prolonged. Some stoning victims are said to have taken 20 minutes to die.\nStoning sentences were widely carried out in the early years after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, but have been rare in recent years.\nThe Iranian judiciary officially placed a moratorium on stoning in 2002, although the punishment remained on the books.\nA group of Iranian lawyers â€“ including prominent women's rights activists, have been campaigning for years to have stoning as a penalty removed from Iranian law.\nThe majority of those stoned are women, who suffer disproportionately from such punishment, human rights groups say.\nOne reason, activists say, is that women are not treated equally before the law and the courts.\nAlso, men stoned to death are buried to the waist, while women are buried deeper, to stop the stones from hitting their breasts.\nThis apparent regard for a woman's modesty actually has a negative impact for women.\nIf a prisoner manages to pull free during a stoning, he or she is acquitted or jailed, but is not executed. It is easier for a man to drag himself free because he is not buried so deeply.\nIn December 2008 a man convicted of adultery escaped death by stoning by dragging himself out of the pit he had been buried in for the punishment.\nBut two other alleged male adulterers were killed by the barbaric method in the same incident, which took place in the north-eastern city of Mashhad.\nIranian activists against stoning say it is not prescribed in the Koran.\nIn terms of its population Iran has the highest execution rate in the world.\nAmnesty International has recorded now fewer than 126 executions between January and June â€“ among them five political prisoners.",

He knew the times of the trains and the taxi numbers.\n'We have no idea why he did it. Was it Stuart who he was after or just a taxi driver? There is no evidence to suggest they knew each other.\n'The only person who knows the answer is Cheetham, but it looks like it was just the thrill of killing somebody.'\nCheetham has always denied the murder and gave police detailed explanations about why CCTV showed him in various places on the day of the shooting.\nHe claimed he went to the station to loan a loaded gun to a man called Geoff, who wanted to teach a drug dealer a lesson.\nMr Justice Alistair MacDuff described Mr Ludlam's murder as 'chilling' as he ordered Cheetham, of Ripley, Derbyshire to be jailed at Nottingham Crown Court last week.\nHe said: 'You are an evil man. You decided to execute a man for your own pleasure and gratification. Any man. There was no motive except your own enjoyment.\n'How chilling that you were prepared to put to death a person you had never met.'",

            "aTxt":"As they playfully smile for the camera, it's hard to believe it was only last month that these twin baby girls were savaged by a fox as they lay in their cots.\nBut a second glance is testament to the ordeal that left nine-month-old sisters Isabella and Lola Koupparis with 'life-changing' injuries.\nIt is the first time that the public have been able to see the full extent of the damage suffered by Isabella, wearing the pink dress, and Lola, in green.\nThe pictures were taken for an interview in which the girls' parents, Nick and Pauline, both 41, describe in the fullest detail yet the night of Saturday, June 5, when the fox intruded into their Â£800,000 East London home.\nThey told how, after hearing their daughters' cries over a baby monitor, they dashed upstairs to find the girls with wounds that looked like they had been caused by a 'cheese grater'.\nEarlier, the family had enjoyed visiting a park in Hackney before going home for a barbecue.\nMrs Koupparis, a former merchandising head for British Home Stores, and her husband, a TV company accountant, put their daughters to bed in separate cots, side by side in their bedroom two flights of stairs up.\nSitting down to watch TV with their son Max, four, they left the patio doors into their garden open and barbecue leftovers cooling on the kitchen table.\nShortly before 10pm Mr Koupparis heard cries over the baby monitor. In the interview, to be shown on BBC1, Mrs Koupparis told of what they found.\n'Isabella was head down in her cot,' she said. 'I noticed some blood and I thought maybe she had a nosebleed so I put the night light on and .. . I saw the fox at the end of Lola's cot.\n'And then I saw that Lola was covered in blood as well. And I literally just wailed, screamed, I don't know how to describe it. And then I heard Nick running up the stairs.'\nBut the fox still stood its ground. 'I sort of lunged at it and it didn't even move,' she said. 'I was just screaming and the girls were crying and Nick lunged a few times and the fox was sort of moving a foot at a time.'\nShe scooped up Lola, but as her husband emerged on to the landing with Isabella in his arms he spotted the fox calmly sitting at the top of the stairs 'as if it was a family pet', 'as if nothing had happened'.\n'I knew Isabella was bleeding a lot by that stage,' he said. 'I could feel the blood was all seeping through her Babygro and I threw whatever came to hand at the fox. It then scarpered down the stairs.'\nMr Koupparis ran into the street and called 999 on his mobile telephone. An ambulance arrived within four minutes and the full extent of the twins' injuries became clear.\nLola's face was swollen and distorted, her eyelid was torn and the bleeding was so severe her parents feared for her sight.\nAs Isabella's clothing was removed Mrs Koupparis saw her damaged arm.\n'Her arm was open and bits of her flesh were literally like just dropping on to Nick's leg,' she said. 'That's how I can remember. It's just . . . it looked like it had been through a cheese grater.'\nAs medics treated the twins, police noticed a fox scratching at the door.\nThe twins were taken to the Royal London Children's Hospital, where consultant reconstructive surgeon Raj Ragoowansi said Isabella's arm injury was the most severe animal bite he had seen in his career.\n'The bite was a very strong bite because as far as the upper arm was concerned the wound was down to the bone,' he said.\n'That takes some considerable force to force a laceration through the muscle and down to the bone.'\nEarly days: When Isabella, left, and Lola came home in bandages\nIsabella suffered respiratory complications during surgery and was transferred to the intensive care unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital.\nIt meant that when Lola was released, her parents still faced an anxious wait for Isabella to recover.\nThey are now both at home, but are still on a course of rabies injections and have been permanently scarred. Isabella is likely to need to keep seeing specialists until her late teens.\nMrs Koupparis said the attack had changed her too, explaining: 'When the girls are here I don't open the doors and it's a bit of a panic every night.'\nMr Koupparis added: 'I think I appreciate it's a freak occurrence that may happen again but the likelihood of it happening to us again is zero.\n'But it probably is the same feeling people have when they've been burgled. They don't want to go back and see their house has been violated and we feel that our family unit has been violated.'\nThe Fox Attack Twins: A BBC One Special will be shown tonight at 7pm.",

He stands by that denial.'\nMs Hagerty told the National Enquirer that the alleged incident occurred after she was booked for a Â£360 massage in a luxury hotel in Portland, Oregon in 2006.\nIn May, Mr Gore and wife Tipper announced they were to split after 40 years of marriage.\nEver since, Mr Gore has been the subject of several rumours alleging their divorce was sparked after he had an affair.\nThe environmental campaigner has not commented on any of those claims - but friends rubbished the reports.\nThe National Enquirer first published its account of the allegations last week.\nThe report was based on what it claimed were police documents detailing Ms Hagerty's complaint.\nAt the time, the magazine - which also broke the story that former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards had cheated on his cancer-stricken wife Elizabeth and had a love child - did not identify her.\nBut today it has run a picture of her on its front cover as she came out of hiding with yet more claims about Mr Gore.\nIn an interview in the magazine set to hit news stands today, she claimed: 'He's not what people think he is.'\nReports in America last week claimed she had been seeking up to $1million to sell her story.\nIt is alleged that Mr Gore checked into the Hotel Lucia in 2006 under the alias 'Mr Stone'.\nThere he booked a treatment during which Ms Hagerty claims the incident took place.\nThe 90-minute massage took place in his room number 903 after 11pm on October 24, followed by a second 75-minute massage immediately after, Ms Hagerty claimed in the police report.\nNo criminal charges were brought against Mr Gore due to lack of evidence. Ms Hagerty repeatedly cancelled follow up interviews with police.\nBut the Portland police prepared a document marked 'Confidential Special Report'.\nThe therapist contacted police several weeks after the alleged incident.\n'I was completely shaken and afraid I would lose my job,' she said told the Enquirer in a report last week.\nIn a letter to the hotel written some days later she attempts to recover the money owed to her, writing: 'I provide at length additional late-hoursâ€™ professional services for your VIP guest per his personal in-person request, with, of course, the utmost of discretion, and did so with only a few hoursâ€™ notice.\n'I am more than confident that the guest was completely happy with the professional services I delivered, and will be more than fine with cleaning up the balance due.'\nThe woman also claims that she has kept her clothing from the night of the alleged attack, which she says provides evidence that corroborate her allegations.\nIn 1998, Monika Lewinsky famously handed over her dress to prosecutors investigating her affair with Clinton.",

            "aTxt":"Foreign Secretary William Hague said today he would be 'very surprised' if Afghan forces were unable to look after their own military affairs by 2014.\nHe insisted there was no timetable for the withdrawal of British troops from Afghanistan and that Prime Minister David Cameron had only expressed 'hope' that they could be out by 2015.\nBut he said he expected the Afghans would be able to take care of security for themselves well in advance of the next general election, if it is held in 2015 as the Government plans.\nMr Hague was speaking as the Taliban leadership snubbed the Foreign Secretary by rejecting any prospect of entering talks with western powers.\nTaliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahedd said in a statement : 'We do not want to talk to anyone till the foreign forces withdraw from Afghanistan. We are certain we are winning. Why should we talk if we have the upper hand, and the foreign troops are considering withdrawal, and there are differences in the ranks of our enemies?'\nMr Hague, speaking on  BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said Britain was committed to the Afghans being able to conduct their military operations and security.\n'That takes time,' he continued. 'But I would be very surprised if that took longer than 2014.'\nMr Cameron said last week he wanted British troops out by 2015. But Mr Hague insisted today that the |Prime Minister was not setting a timetable but expressing a 'hope'.\n'Of course, in the next parliament he would hope - anyone would hope - that the British combat troops were coming home,' he said.'But he has also stressed that's not setting a timetable for what happens over the next few years.'\nMr Hague went on: 'We have always said, the chief of the defence staff has said, that the Afghan forces should be able to conduct their own affairs, should be able to stand up for themselves without other nations having to be alongside them, by 2014.\n'So I don't think it's any great surprise or any great mystery about us saying that by 2015 really we should be in the position where Afghan national security forces will be looking after themselves.\n'Will there still be British troops who are training, could there still be British troops in that kind of role? Well, of course there could be but this combat operation is what the Prime Minister has quite rightly been talking about over the last few days.'\nHis comments came after Defence Secretary Liam Fox appeared to strike a different tone about Britain's mission last night.\nSpeaking in Washington, he issued a blunt warning that the UK and its coalition allies in Afghanistan needed to 'hold our nerve' and show the resolve to 'see the job through'.\nPremature withdrawal of Nato forces would, he said, be a 'shot in the arm' to violent Islamic extremists around the world and a 'betrayal' of the sacrifices made by British forces.\nDowning Street denied there were any differences between Mr Cameron and Dr Fox.",

            "aTxt":"A giant 4ft 9ins bird which had been on the run since Christmas has died after the RSPCA made a disastrous attempt to rescue it.\nThe rhea was recaptured by staff from the charity on Wednesday after being cornered and tranquillised with a dart gun in a country lane in Suffolk.\nBut the creature died around four hours later when it suffered a suspected panic attack while recovering from the anaesthetic.\nThe flightless rhea, which weighed around 90lbs, is thought to have escaped several months ago from its enclosure on an estate near Woodbridge, Suffolk.\nIt managed to survive the freezing winter and was repeatedly spotted by locals in fields and on lanes around Campsea Ashe, Marlesford, Tunstall and Eyke.\nThe RSPCA decided to capture it over fears that it could run on to a road and cause an accident, even though it seemed to be thriving in the wilds of Suffolk\nKate Cornforth, an animal collection officer for the charity, made several visits to monitor it - but was unable to capture it on her own.\nShe returned on Wednesday with RSPCA chief inspector Mark Thompson who was armed with his tranquilliser rifle.\nHelped by two villages, the pair tracked the white-feathered rhea down to a wheat field in Eyke - but it kept running away when they got near.\nThe bird, a native of South America, finally went through a hedge into a nearby lane where they managed to corner so it could not get away.\nMr Thompson fired his first shot into the body of the bird which could run at 40mph, but the needle was unable to penetrate its thick feathers.\nHis second shot was a success as it hit the top of the bird's thigh, injecting tranquilliser straight into its bloodstream, so it was dazed within seconds.\nThe semi-conscious bird was loaded into a trailer after the two-hour rescue operation, and taken to be re-homed with a bird lover who has other pet rheas in Eye, Suffolk.\nRSPCA spokeswoman Nicola Walker said: 'It was put in a field to recover and appeared to be breathing normally.\n'It lay down for a while, but the new owner said it suffered some sort of panic attack and died.\n'We do not know what the cause of death was and we will not be holding a post mortem.\n'It could have been suffering from sort of illness before it was rescued by us. It is obviously a very sad ending for all those involved in the rescue.\n'We certainly followed all our procedures by the book and we were hoping that it would settle in happily at its new home.'\nRSPCA chief inspector Mark Thompson insisted the charity had been right to attempt to capture the bird - even though it had not harmed anyone.\nHe said: 'We were concerned for its welfare because of reports that it was crossing roads.\n'We were worried it could have caused a disastrous accident. It was so big that it could have caused a lot of damage to a car and people might have been injured or killed.\n'We recaptured it in a very controlled way and caused it the minimum amount of distress.\n'The dosage of tranquilliser was right for the size of bird and just put it in a dazed state so we could recapture it and put in the trailer.\n'It appeared to be recovering well from the affect of the drug, but unfortunately it died.\n'Birds do suffer from stress and this is one of those unfortunate things.\n'My guess is that it could have suffered a complication as a result of being tranquillised. These things can happen. It is a great shame.'\nThe white-feathered rhea is thought to have survived in the wild by eating plants, seeds, roots and fruit.",

            "aTxt":"A jealous husband slashed his wife's throat with a pair of scissors before throwing himself in front of a train after discovering she was having an affair.\nThe man, named locally as Steven Rees, 49, was killed when he threw himself onto the tracks at Twyford Station in Berkshire just minutes after ambulance crews had found a woman dead in a house in nearby Woodley. She has been named as his wife, Ann, 45.\nThe man phoned a friend to confess to the murder as he drove to the station, asking the friend to make sure the couple's 13-year-old daughter did not arrive home and discover the body, The Sun newspaper reported.\nA police source said Mr Rees told his friend what he had done, saying his wife had been having an affair.\nHe said he planned to kill himself. The friend heard a train, followed by a thud and the call was cut off.\nThe semi-detached house in Malone Road, opposite a children's play area, remained cordoned off last night. All the windows at the front of the house were open, with trophies visible in an upstairs room.\nNeighbours said the couple and their daughter, thought to attend a local secondary school, had lived in the house for several years.\nOne of them, a pensioner who has lived in Malone Road for more than 20 years, said: 'I had met the couple and their daughter on a social occasion a few years ago and knew them to say hello to. I would have put them in their early 40s, with their daughter between 11 and 13.\n'I heard absolutely nothing this afternoon. As far as I'm concerned they were a nice young couple. I hadn't heard any arguments or anything over the garden fence.\n'It's a complete shock. I'm in absolute disbelief. What a terrible day for their daughter. I can't contemplate what she's going to go through.'\nThames Valley Police confirmed the body found at the house was that of an adult female. They are treating both deaths as unexplained and have not yet confirmed if they are linked.\nA South Central Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We had a call at 13.47 to an incident in Malone Road, Woodley.\nIt was reported to us as a female with stab wounds. We got there at 13.50. We did not treat or convey. She was beyond help.\n'When we arrived at the scene and saw the patient we informed police.\n'At 13.57 there was another incident, where a male had been hit by a train at Twyford. We were on the scene at 13.59.'\nMalone Road resident Eileen Mackey said the area has a low crime rate and is typically made up of two and three-bedroom terrace properties.\nShe said: 'It's a nice area round here, near a park. It's probably the quietest street in the whole of Woodley. You don't get any crime here at all and I've lived here for years.'\nPolice tape surrounded a Ford Focus parked outside Twyford station. A photo frame was face down on top of a towel on the passenger seat.\nThames Valley Police said they are not searching for anyone else in connection with the deaths.\nThe pair have yet to be formally identified.",

            "aTxt":"Al Qaeda has launched its first online propaganda magazine in English.\nCalled 'Inspire', the magazine has features including one on 'How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom',\nIt could help the terror group recruit inside the US and Europe.\nIt is being run by Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, which has been linked to the failed Christmas Day bombing attempt of a US-bound airliner.\nThe launch suggests that, as Al Qaeda's core has been weakened by CIA drone airstrikes, the group hopes to broaden its reach inside the US, where officials have seen a spate of home-grown terrorists.\n'This new magazine is clearly intended for the aspiring jihadist in the US or UK who may be the next Fort Hood murderer or Times Square bomber,' Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution scholar and former CIA officer, said.\nTuesday's launch did not go smoothly. The magazine was 67 pages long, but all but the first three pages were just garbled computer code, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist websites and obtained a copy of the magazine.\nThe table of contents included articles such as 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,' which promised to be 'a detailed yet short, easy-to-read manual on how to make a bomb using ingredients found in a kitchen.'\n'We also call upon and encourage our readers to contribute by sending their articles, comments or suggestions to us,' the magazine's introduction read.\nAt the heart of Al Qaeda's propaganda effort is Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical US-born cleric now living in Yemen. Authorities say his online sermons, in English, have inspired several recent terrorist plots in the United States.\nThe magazine promotes an article by al-Awlaki titled 'May Our Souls be Sacrificed for You.' But like most of the magazine, the article did not appear in the version circulated Tuesday.\nUntil now, Al-Qaeda has relied on Arabic websites to carry its message. Now it appears to be capitalizing on its recent success recruiting inside the US.\nUsing propaganda on the Internet, the terrorist group has been able to attract Americans such as Bryant Neal Vinas and Najibullah Zazi, two admitted Al Qaeda terrorists. Both were radicalised in New York and travelled to Pakistan to join the fight against the US.\nIn a recent terrorism case in New Jersey, prosecutors say two US citizens watched al-Awlaki's videos on their cell phones and took inspiration in his call for smaller, single acts of terrorism.",

Both the successes and the lessons from this pandemic should inform policy and planning for the next one because there will be a next one, and the next one might be more severe.\nThe report also found:\nâ—� The UK was \"well-prepared\" for the outbreak thanks to stockpiling of the antiviral Tamiflu.\nâ—� At one point during the pandemic all the UK's paediatric critical care beds for very sick children were in use.\nâ—� Britain's preparations for the outbreak were 'soundly based' in terms of value for money, reflecting the low cost of vaccination in relation to the value of lives saved.\nâ—� Expectations of what scientific advice and methods could offer were too high during the early stages of the pandemic, when only limited data was available.\nâ—� Some of the terms used by the Government were confusing. In particular 'containment' was used to describe a strategy which was intended not to contain the disease but slow the spread, and 'reasonable worst case' sounded like a likely outcome when in fact it meant the opposite.\nâ—� The containment phase of the UK's response to the outbreak lasted longer and took up more resources than had been expected.\nâ—� British newspapers and broadcasters were responsible in reporting the pandemic, in contrast to the media in some other countries.\nThe study come just weeks after Labour MP Paul Flynn accused the World Health Organisation (WHO) of frightening 'the whole world with the possibility that a major plague was on the way'.\nAfter producing a report on the swine flu response for the Council of Europe, he concluded that the world wasted billions on vaccines and anti virals.\nThe WHO is conducting it's own investigation into the outbreak.\nIt has also emerged that the NHS was being forced to cut services because of the huge cost of the unfounded swine flu scare.\nA survey has found that as many as one in six health trusts may have to slash services - or already have done so - to recoup costs.\nThe average cost of the crisis to primary care trusts was Â£340,000 - enough to pay the salaries of 17 nurses.",

            "aTxt":"Modern educational theories that focus on 'skills' rather than facts have resulted in a generation of university students that have little knowledge of our history or culture, the Schools Minister said today.\nAddressing a Reform conference in central London today, Nick Gibb said 'Knowledge is a basic building block for a successful life' and that children need to understand the fundamentals of subjects like Science, Maths, English and History.\n'Too many children are leaving education without knowing who Miss Havisham is, or who was in charge at the Battle of Waterloo'\nHe cited a study by Professor Derek Matthews, an economics lecturer at Cardiff University.\nFor the past three years he has tested his undergraduates with five questions that he believes every 18-year-old should be able to answer.\nThe results showed \"depressing evidence of the state of teaching knowledge in History,\" he said.\n'Almost twice as many students thought Nelson rather than Wellington was in charge at the Battle of Waterloo and nearly 90 per cent couldn't name a single British Prime Minister of the 19th century.'\n'And these were students at a university whose entry requirement is an A and two Bs at A level.'\nMr Gibb said he did not want to criticise these students, but he added: 'What is to be criticised is an education system which has relegated the importance of knowledge in favour of ill-defined learning skills'.\nEveryone should know about great literary figures, including Miss Havisham, the jilted bride in the classic Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, he said.\n'Getting to grips with the basics - of elements, of metals, of halogens, of acids; of what happens when hydrogen and oxygen come together; of photosynthesis; of cells - is difficult, but once learned you have the ability at least to comprehend some of the great advances in genetics, physics and other scientific fields that are revolutionising our lives'  Mr Gibb told the conference.\n'Once these concepts are grasped it opens up and develops the mind and takes you one tiny step further to understanding the complex world in which we live. Each new concept facilitates deeper understanding, and the ability to think more creatively and more independently about the way the world works, and about society.'\nHe went on to say: 'The facts, dates and narrative of our history in fact join us all together. The rich language of Shakespeare should be the common property of us all. The great figures of literature that still populate the conversations of all those who regard themselves as well-educated should be known to all'.\n'Yet to more and more people Miss Havisham is a stranger and even the most basic history and geography a mystery.'\n'These concepts must be taught. And they must be taught to everyone. Sadly, that is not always the case.'\nMr Gibb said: 'I believe very strongly that education is about the transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next.'\n'Knowledge is the basic building block for a successful life. Without understanding the fundamental concepts of maths or science it is impossible properly to comprehend huge areas of modern life.'\n'With little or no knowledge of our nationâ€™s history, understanding the present is that much harder.'",

He had been on his way to join a demonstration.\nHe was told by two police officers that he was being searched under section 44 of the Terrorism Act for articles which could be used in connection with terrorism.\nNothing incriminating was found, although computer print-outs giving information about the demonstration were seized by the officers.\nMr Gillan was released after being detained for about 20 minutes.\nLater that day Miss Quinton, a journalist wearing a photographer's jacket, carrying a small bag and holding a camera in her hand, was stopped close to the arms fair.\nShe was said to have emerged from some bushes and was planning to film the protests.\nShe was searched and told to stop filming. Nothing incriminating was found.\nThe police record of the search showed she was stopped for five minutes, but Miss Quinton said she thought it was 'more like 30 minutes'.\nShe claimed to have felt so intimidated and distressed that she did not feel able to return to the demonstration although it had been her intention to make a documentary or sell footage of it.\nA Home Office spokesman said: 'The Government has already committed to reviewing counter-terrorism legislation, which will include the operation of the Section 44 stop and search provisions.\n'We are currently giving full consideration to the judgement and its implications.'",

Another meeting is planned for this morning when it will be decided if it is safe to re-open the unit.\nJulie Firth, director of nursing, said: 'We apologise to the small number of women expecting to give birth in Colchester who will inevitably be inconvenienced and also to their partners and families. So far five women have been affected.\n'Our staff have been contacting these women by phone and have also made the ambulance service and the maternity units at Ipswich, Chelmsford, Bury St Edmunds and Harlow aware.'\nShe added: 'We are working very hard to resolve the electrical and equipment issues. A decision will be taken at a meeting today about whether we will by then be ready to resume a full and normal service.'\nMrs Firth stressed that none of the 16 babies on the neo-natal unit at the time of the equipment failure were injured.\nAs an additional back-up, four incubators have been borrowed from Ipswich Hospital.All other maternity services at Colchester General Hospital, such as antenatal clinics and the antenatal assessment unit, are running as normal.\nA trust spokesman said: 'This situation will change when the electrical issue, which is confined to the neo-natal unit, has been fully resolved, and when the trust has been able to access additional equipment.\n'The maternity units that Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust manage at the community hospitals at Clacton and Harwich continue to run as normal, and women still have the option of a home birth.'",

            "aTxt":"Dramatic new testimony has heaped pressure on ministers to reopen the investigation into the death of Dr David Kelly.\nA female colleague claims that the UN weapons inspector could not have committed suicide as claimed, as he was too weak to cut his own wrist.\nMai Pedersen, a U.S. Air Force officer who served with Dr Kelly's inspection team in Iraq, said a hand and arm injury meant that the 59-year-old even 'had difficulty cutting his own steak'.\nDr Kelly was found dead in woods near his home in 2003 after the Government exposed him as the source of a BBC report questioning Tony Blair's government's case for war in Iraq.\nIn a letter to the new Attorney General Dominic Grieve through her lawyers, Miss Pedersen also said Dr Kelly had difficulty swallowing pills, casting serious doubt on the Hutton Inquiry conclusion that he swallowed 29 painkillers before slitting his left wrist.\nCampaigners hope her extraordinary intervention will convince ministers of the need for a new investigation. Mr Grieve has already indicated that he believes the case could merit a further inquiry.\nHad she testified at the Hutton Inquiry, Miss Pedersen would have revealed that in the months leading up to his death Dr Kelly was unable to use his right hand for basic tasks requiring any strength such as slicing food because of a painful elbow injury.\nMiss Pedersen says he would therefore have had to be a 'contortionist' to have killed himself by slashing his left wrist, as Lord Hutton concluded in 2004.\nShe called for a 'formal, independent, and complete' review of the case at the earliest opportunity, saying it was the only way to achieve 'closure'.\nThe letter said the absence of a full coroner's inquest into Dr Kelly's death and 'perpetual secrecy' meant it was ' crying out' for further scrutiny.\nDr Kelly, who worked for both the UN and later the Ministry of Defence, was found dead seven years ago next month in an Oxfordshire wood.\nHe was said to be deeply upset after being exposed as the source of a controversial BBC news report questioning Britain's grounds for going to war in Iraq.\nThe report, by journalist Andrew Gilligan, stated that Tony Blair's press spokesman Alastair Campbell had 'sexed up' the case for war for political reasons.\nBut, unusually for a death of this nature, no full coroner's inquest has ever been held. Instead, Tony Blair appointed retired judge Lord Hutton to chair a non-statutory public inquiry into the circumstances leading to his body being discovered.\nTony Blair (left) appointed retired judge Lord Hutton (right) to chair the inquiry in Dr Kelly's death. He concluded he died by haemorrhage after slashing his left wrist\nWitnesses, who included Dr Kelly's widow, Janice, and Tony Blair, were not questioned under oath.\nLord Hutton concluded that Dr Kelly died by haemorrhage after slashing his left wrist but, as the Mail reported last week, his death certificate was officially registered before the Hutton Inquiry ended and it was not properly completed.\nIt was not signed by a doctor or coroner and does not state a place of death, as all death certificates should if this information can be established. This leaves open the possibility that he died somewhere other than where his body was found.\nTo further deepen the mystery, all evidence relating to the post-mortem has been classified for an incredible 70 years.\nMiss Pedersen's view is significant because she knew Dr Kelly so well, both personally and professionally.\nThe pair worked together in Iraq in the 1990s and remained close friends until his death, although Miss Pedersen, 50, has always that she and Dr Kelly were not romantically involved.\nShe was initially asked to give evidence to the Hutton Inquiry in 2003 and agreed to do so, but was not called. This was because, it is claimed, the inquiry would not allow her to testify in private.\nHer letter to Mr Grieve, dated June 10, states: 'We understand you have indicated a willingness to consider possibly reopening the investigation into the continuing controversy into the death of Dr Kelly.\n'Given the absence of any coroner's inquest and the perpetual secrecy surrounding the post-mortem examination, it is painfully obvious that this matter continues to cry out for a formal, independent and complete review. Ms Pedersen fully supports and adds her voice to such an effort.\n'The passage of time not diminish either the public's interest or the government's responsibility to ascertain the full truth, whatever that might be.'\nThe Hutton Report failed to allay suspicions of foul play in Dr Kelly's death. On the morning of July 17, Dr Kelly mysteriously told a friend by email that there were 'many dark actors playing games'.\nIn 2007 it was discovered, through a Freedom of Information request, that the pruning knife he is said to have used to cut his wrist had no fingerprints on it.",

It is my duty as her only daughter to protect her.â€™\nThe 21 hours of tapes, made over the past year, were given to her by Pascal  Bonnefoy, the butler, and then handed to the police.\nIn one extract Mrs Bettencourt discusses Arros, the Seychelles island, before saying she had left Banier â€˜everything in my willâ€™, but then adds that she â€˜likes him very much, heâ€™s very intelligent, but heâ€™s killing meâ€™.\nMrs Bettencourt is heard saying: â€˜He's becoming too demanding: â€œgive me this, give me thatâ€�.â€™ Banier, who lives with 36-year-old Martin dâ€™Orgeval, also a photographer, in Paris, is known for befriending old ladies.\nHe has been especially close to Mrs Bettencourt for more than 20 years, since the death of her husband, Andre, a former government minister.\nBanier is known as the â€˜photographer to the starsâ€™ in France after shooting big names like actor Johnny Depp.\nMr Bonnefoy, the butler, said he taped her conversations because he could no longer bear to see his employer â€˜being abused by people without scruplesâ€™.\nMrs Bettencourt, the primary shareholder at cosmetics giant L'OrÃ©al, said she was now putting her tax affairs â€˜in orderâ€™.\nShe is hoping that the tapes â€“ which she describes as â€˜illegal and odious eavesdroppingâ€™ â€“ can be ruled in-admissible in court thanks to Franceâ€™s strict privacy laws.\nThe trial, which is expected to run until next Tuesday, continues.",

            "aTxt":"The family of a baby boy born with back-to-front KNEES said they were disgusted that he was still waiting for specialist treatment months after his birth.\nGabriell Camilleri-Nugent was born with hyperextended knees and bronchomalacia, meaning his lungs and airways are too small for him to breathe on his own.\nA 20-week scan showed Gabriell's legs were doubled back near his head in the womb, instead of being curled up in the foetal position.\nWhen he was born by caesarian section last December his shocked family said he looked 'like he was doing the splits' as his knee caps are effectively back to front.\nNow aged six months, he has worn plaster casts on both legs since birth but he is sitll waiting to be transferred to a specialist hospital for treatment.\nHis grandmother, Carol, 50, said the youngster's health is being compromised by NHS bureaucracy.\nThe mother-of-five from Bedford, said: 'Gabriell is still in neo-natal just lying in his cot. He has never been outside and we can only pick him up on a good day.\n'He has got lung problems and dislocated knees but we don't know if that's a particular syndrome because he has not been assessed since he was three weeks old.\n'Nobody wants to take control and the hospitals just kept moving the goal posts. We don't know when or where he can be treated because no one wants to take him.'\nShe added: 'The nurses have been wonderful and are backing us but officials are stopping him being treated. It's disgusting how the NHS is treating our children.'\nWhen Gabriell's mother Shahna Camilleri, 17, gave birth in Bedford Hospital last December, doctors quickly realised he needed to be transferred to a specialist unit.\nThey sent him to the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, but at three weeks old and weighing just under 4lbs he was too weak for surgery.\nSo the youngster was transferred him to the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, to gain weight.\nHis parents were told he would go back to the Royal Brompton when he hit 7lbs, but although he achieved this aged three months in March, he is still waiting.\nThey said the Royal Brompton said he needed to be heavier still and they had no free beds.\nNow aged six months, Gabriell remains in the neo-natal unit in Lister Hospital where they lack the specialist expertise to treat him.\nFour weeks ago his family were told he is third on the waiting list to be transferred to Great Ormond Street Hopsital but were given no clues as to how long this could take.\nSince birth, Gabriell has been permanently attached to a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine to help him breathe.\nHe also has dysmorphic features, wears plaster casts on both legs and contracted the E.coli virus twice and pneumonia once.\nHis mother Shahna and father Connor Nugent, 17, who is training to be a football coach, said they felt let down by the NHS and frustrated with the delay in getting Gabriell to a specialist unit.\nShe said: 'I spend around eight hours day at the hospital, at least five days a week, and rely on lifts from family and friends to be able to see him.\n'It's been awful for us. I haven't even been able to hold my own baby or feed him without a nurse being present.\n'Our focus now is to get him into Great Ormond Street, that is the only hospital left that will be able to treat him.\n'After six months of him just being kept alive at Lister we just want to get him treated and given a proper diagnosis as we still have no idea what is wrong.'\nA spokeswoman for Royal Brompton Hospital, a specialist heart and lung centre, insisted they were not the best place to treat Gabriell's severe health problems.\nShe said: 'We have been in discussions with colleagues at Lister Hospital about the best treatment for baby Gabriell for some time.\n'Given Gabriell's complex medical condition and multiple organ problems we feel that he would be best cared for at a specialist centre that can treat all his needs.'\nA spokesman for the Lister Hospital said Gabriell's needs are highly specialist and he is need of complex treatment.\nHe said: 'We are helping support him with breathing and developmental requirements but we don't have the specialism or resources to do more.\n'The actual treatment he needs has to be provided by a specialist centre like Great Ormond Street or Royal Brompton.'",

All were tricked.'\nShe ordered the men to complete 240 hours of unpaid work in the next 12 months and told them they face restraining orders preventing them from selling on the internet.Costs will be decided at a later hearing.\nTwo charges of possession of items that could be used in fraud and another charge of conspiracy to defraud were ordered to lie on file.\nSpeaking outside court, a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said the force recovered 120 prints during the investigation which, if sold as genuine, could fetch more than Â£200,000.",

There are a million Muslim women in the UK and only a few thousand are estimated to wear a veil.\n'Banning the veil will not help those few women to integrate. But it will play into the hands of extremist parties.'\nHeather Harvey, Amnesty International UK Stop Violence Against Women campaign manager, said: 'For those women who are being coerced into wearing full face veils, a ban would only make matters worse. Either they're criminalised if they go out in public or, more likely, they are confined to their homes.'",

Now police are scrambling to find him.\nHis disappearance is an acute embarrassment to the Cypriot authorities â€“ and is likely to infuriate Washington.\nMetsos is believed to be one of the paymasters of the alleged Russian spy ring. Ten of his co-accused were arrested in the U.S. on Monday, and are due to appear in court today.\nToday police in Cyprus searched airports, ports and yacht marinas in a desperate attempt to tracked the alleged spy paymaster down.\nPolice also examined surveillance video from crossing points on the war-divided island, fearing the suspect may have slipped into the breakaway north - a diplomatic no-mans-land recognized only by Turkey.\nJustice Minister Loucas Louca on Thursday admitted that a judge's decision to release Christopher Robert Metsos 'may have been mistaken'\n'We have some information and we hope that we will arrest him soon,' Louca told reporters, without elaborating.\nThe American ambassador to Cyprus, Frank Urbancic, held an hour-long meeting with Cyprus President Dimitris Christofias today.\nBut a government spokesman insisted the U.S. had made no formal complaint.\n'The investigation is in the hands of the Cypriot government,' a spokesman for the American embassy said.\nMetsos was arrested in Cyprus on Tuesday as he tried to flee the country on board a flight to Budapest.\nHe had a one-way ticket and was using a Canadian passport.\nBut despite the accusations against him and the circumstances of his arrest, he was controversially bailed for a month pending an extradition hearing.\nIt is rare for Cyprus to bail foreign prisoners who are being considered for extradition.\nMetsos - bailed for just Â£16,400 - was supposed to check in at a Cypriot police station daily until his bail hearing, scheduled for July 29.\nBut on the first day, yesterday, he failed to comply. Police have issued an arrest warrant.\nTen other members of the alleged spy ring, including former London resident Anna Chapman, were arrested in the United States on Monday.\nThey are all being held without bail and are due to appear in American courts today.\nU.S. officials allege Metsos is a Russian secret agent who made cash drop-offs to some of those arrested in the States.\nOn his arrest on Tuesday, he was required to surrender his travel documents and his name was put on a stop list at all ports and airports.\nOne way for fugitives to flee Cyprus is through the unrecognised Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the divided island.\nThose crossing the islandâ€™s dividing green line from the south need to show identification at Turkish Cypriot checkpoints - but a suspected spy could easily filter through on forged documents.\nAlternatively, Metsos could have fled Cyprus by taking a boat from Larnaca to nearby Turkey, Israel, Syria or Lebanon.\nHis lawyer, Michalis Papathanasiou, who had successfully argued Metsos was not a flight risk, told The Mail: 'I donâ€™t know what to say.\n'They called me from the police station to tell me he didnâ€™t show up.\n'I was waiting for his call today to discuss the details of his case and he never called.'\nMetsos, who arrived in Cyprus on June 17, claimed he was an innocent tourist.\nCypriot officials vehemently denied insinuations in some British media that he was not remanded in custody as a favour to Moscow.\n'That suggestion is absolutely ridiculous. Our judiciary is totally independent,' a senior official in the attorney generalâ€™s office told the Mail.\nProsecutors there met yesterday to discuss whether to challenge the Larnaca judgeâ€™s bail ruling.\n'We decided against appealing because we believed there was not much chance of success,' one said.\nGranting bail to suspects facing extradition proceedings is highly unusual in Cyprus - but not unprecedented.\n'We believe the judge made the wrong decision but it was his decision,' a state prosecutor said.\nThe Greek Cypriots, who represent the island internationally, have long been on friendly terms with Russia.\nCyprus is home to a large Russian business community and Nicosia boasts a sprawling Russian embassy.\nAlso accused: Mikhael Semenko, left, and Vicky Pelaez, right, are also alleged to be part of the spy ring. They have been arrested in the U.S.\nAlone among EU members, the Cypriot government is headed by a nominal communist partly, Akel, that has close relations with Moscow.\nPresident Demetris Christofias is a fluent Russian speaker who studied in Moscow.\nWhile the attorney generalâ€™s office was surprised Metsos was granted bail, officials there vehemently denied the courtâ€™s decision had been influenced by political or diplomatic interests.\nSpeaking before Metsos absconded, a senior Western diplomat said: 'There are close relations between Cyprus and Russia but itâ€™s quite a leap to say they were doing Russia a favour.\n'Itâ€™s quite an allegation to make about Cyprusâ€™s judiciary.'",

            "aTxt":"A cancer sufferer was left in agony after a Â£2,000 hair weave went dramatically wrong - and had to be taken off with chewing gum remover.\nMother-of-one Vanessa Green, 39, paid for the procedure at an exclusive salon after chemotherapy caused her chestnut locks to become thin.\nThe weave involved human hair being glued on top of her own, but within hours it began tugging at her scalp, leaving her in agony.\n'Devastated': Vanessa Green (above right before her hair started to fall out) had hoped to improve her appearance after chemotherapy caused her hair to thin, but a Â£2,000 weave went horribly wrong (left)\nA technician from the salon had to rush to her home to remove the weave - which pulled of even more of her own hair - using a solvent for removing chewing gum.\nThe hour-long weave had been carried out at White Cliffs Hair Replacement Studio in Bristol.\nMrs Green said: 'Every woman worries about her hair and I've always taken a lot of care in the way I look.\n'I've been through a lot with chemotherapy. I was worried that my hair was thinner than before. So I decided to give myself a boost with a hair weave - the clinic said it would provide the volume my hair needed at the front.\n'But I was surprised when they just seemed to glue a hair piece to my head. I questioned the hair consultant and she told me, \"I'm a professional. I know what I am doing\".'\nThe salon has admitted responsibility and said a member of staff had been disciplined.\nShe was recommended the Volumizer treatment, which claims to use the finest grade of human hair available to match the client's own hair's texture, density, length, style, and color.\nMrs Green said: 'I thought I was in good hands and for Â£2,000 it didn't come cheap.\n'I was told it would take several hours to put the weave in so I was surprised when my appointment only lasted about an hour. It didn't feel right and before long I was in agony - the hair piece was pulling on my real hair.\n'I contacted the studio and after I made enough fuss they sent a consultant to my home.'\nShe went through a further five hours of agony as the consultant lifted the weave from her scalp.\nShe said: 'I could hardly bear to look in the mirror afterwards. A lot of my real hair was now on the floor - I had bald patches. I looked a real fright.'\nMrs Green is making a full recovery after treatment for cancer of the bladder, but she was left more horrified by her appearance after her hair nightmare.\nShe couldn't leave her house in Blackwood, Gwent, and kept a towel by the front door in case anyone knocked so she could wrap it around her head.\nShe said: 'I am utterly devastated by what they did to me. I've seen a trichologist and he's told me the hair I have left is dead - I may as well chop it all off - it's like candyfloss.\n'I thought I was going to feel fabulous after my treatment at the studio but I couldn't feel worse.'\nWarren Vaheeswaran, a director of White Cliffs, said: 'We have passed this matter onto our insurance company. We are, of course, very sorry for what's happened to Vanessa.\n'We have given her a full refund and offered to pay for laser treatment to replace her hair. The stylist has been disciplined. She made a judgement call about what she thought was best for the client at the time.'",

            "aTxt":"A rogue trader who tried to cover up a string of disastrous share deals which lost his employers Â£2.5million was jailed for 30 months today.\nJonathan Bunn, 31, bet that stocks in banking giant HSBC would fall while working as a broker at City firm Lewis Charles Securities (LCS).\nBunn built up a huge 'short position', agreeing to sell millions of HSBC shares despite not owning them, hoping to capitalise when their price went down.\nAs an 'inter-dealer' broker, Bunn was not authorised to sell stocks without first finding a source for them, so he covered his tracks by forging purchase slips stating he had found a willing seller.\nWhen the market price of HSBC continued to rise, Bunn found he had promised to sell 6.95m shares which he did not own, and came clean to his bosses.\nThe unauthorised trades ended up costing LCS Â£2,557,026, and cost 12 people their jobs.\nBunn was jailed for two-and-a-half years at Southwark Crown Court after he admitted a single count of false accounting.\nJudge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, told him: 'They amounted to a very serious breach of trust on your part.\n'You were not stealing your company's money but you were gambling with it in a very reckless and dishonest manner.\n'I think I can fairly say that as a result of your very serious misconduct you have certainly made a very significant contribution to bringing this company at least temporarily to its knees.\n'In my view, it is essential that persons working in the financial services industry should understand that if they behave dishonestly and thereby either at the end of a telephone line of with the stroke of a pen, place other people's money seriously at risk, and in this case that meant over Â£2m, they will be punished for doing so.'\nProsecutor David Levy said Bunn, who has an MA in economics from St Andrews University, Scotland, was employed as an inter-dealer broker at CLS' offices in Worship Street in the City between March and July 2009.\nHe was authorised by the FSA to take telephone calls from clients who wanted to buy and sell shares, and trade in the stocks they were looking for - but was always required to 'match' a buyer and a seller before completing the deal.\nHe was not paid a salary, but split any commission he made with the company 50-50, and was required to hire his desk and equipment.\nIn the five months he was at CLS in the lead-up to the HSBC deals in July, Bunn made a personal profit of Â£300,000, the court heard.\nOn July 22 he began to build up an unauthorised short-position in HSBC.\nBunn gambled the price of shares in the bank would fall from 5.49 a share, and that he would be able to make a profit by agreeing to sell them at that level and later buy them at the lower price.\nBecause he was not allowed to make such 'proprietary' trades, he handed in four falsified purchase slips, stating he had found people willing to sell CLS the necessary amount of shares.\nBy July 31, Bunn had agreed to sell 6.95m shares in HSBC, and the shares were valued at 5.84p each.\nKnowing that his deception was about to be uncovered, he sent a text message to a senior manager at CLS stating: 'I'm sorry and I know realised how serious this is.'\nIn order to 'close' its short position, CLS was eventually forced to buy the 6.95m shares at 6.08p a share - for a total of more than Â£2.5m.\nMr Levy told the court that as a 'direct result' the company lost profits and contracts and was forced to make 12 staff redundant and cut pay by 20 per cent across the board.\nGregory Fishwick, defending, said that his client had not set out to defraud his company, but had seen his short position 'spiral out of control'.\nHe said the defendant had been 'propping up' CLS in the period leading up to the offences, and had been told by his bosses that he was doing a 'fantastic job'.\nBunn was motivated by 'pride' and not wanting to admit his failure as much as greed, the court heard.\nMr Fishwick added that since his offences came to light, Bunn's wife has thrown him out of their home in Surrey, and he has moved back in with his parents in Manchester.\nThe court heard Bunn also built up debts of Â£60,000 with an online spread betting firm.\nBunn admitted a single count of false accounting.",
